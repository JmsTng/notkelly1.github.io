            <h1>Hi, I'm Kelly Wang</h1>
            <p><br>a high school student attending AYJSS with a passion for data science and health science. I live in Toronto, and I am always looking to contribute to my community through my interest and curiosity for learning new things. I'm currently self-learning HTML and CSS.
            
            <br><br>At school, I founded the AYJ HOSA chapter, and I'm the President of AYJ MUN.
            
            <br><br>In my commitment to my community, I have also represented over 6,000 High School Students in the Don Valley North Riding in Ontario’s Model Parliament Program, and I am an alumni of SHAD uCalgary '24.
            
            You can usually find me working on my projects, grinding Chopin études on the piano, and sampling various desserts (I love tiramisu the most).<br><br><br>
